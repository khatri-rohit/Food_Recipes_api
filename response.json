Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too. So in our opinion: dig in, skin and all!",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."
